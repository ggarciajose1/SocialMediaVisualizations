# SocialMediaVisualizations
Class project of MGT 4250 Fall 2023 at Elon University

This project aims to analyze two separate datasets containing information about Android and iOS mobile applications. The goal is to identify trends and characteristics that contribute to userattraction for each platform. By examining factors such as app category, ratings, reviews, and other relevant features, we seek to provide actionable insights for developers and marketers to enhance app visibility and user engagement.

## Questions & Significance 
1) What is the distribution of user ratings and reviews for different Android app categories?
  -  This question will help us understand the user sentiment towards different types of apps on both platforms. It will also reveal which categories tend to receive higher ratings andmore reviews, indicating higher user engagement. It is important to understand the distribution of user ratings and reviews across app categories is crucial for developers and marketers. Positive reviews and high ratings significantly impact app visibility and trust among potential users. Research has shown that higher ratings lead to increased downloads and user retention.

2) Is there a correlation between app/category and score rating?
  - This question will help us determine if higher download counts are associated with better user ratings. It can provide insights into the relationship between app popularity and user satisfaction. Investigating the correlation between downloads and user ratings is essential for developers. It helps them determine if increasing downloads directly translates to higher user satisfaction.

3) Is there is any correlation between the various ratings and the device being an Android or iOS product?
  - This question will help us determine if there is any correlation with ratings depending on the device product being an android or iOS device.  Identifying app categories with the highest user engagement provides valuable insights for developers and marketers looking to target specific demographics or optimize their app offerings. It allows for more targeted marketing efforts and can lead to increased user acquisition and retention.
