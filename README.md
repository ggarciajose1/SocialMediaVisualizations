# SocialMediaVisualizations
Class project of MGT 4250 Fall 2023 at Elon University

This project aims to analyze two separate datasets containing information about Android and iOS mobile applications. The goal is to identify trends and characteristics that contribute to userattraction for each platform. By examining factors such as app category, ratings, reviews, and other relevant features, we seek to provide actionable insights for developers and marketers to enhance app visibility and user engagement.

## Questions

3) Is there a correlation between app/category and score rating?
4) Is there is any correlation between the various ratings and the device being an Android or iOS product
